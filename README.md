# Portfolio Website (Built with v0)

This is my personal portfolio website, built as a space to share experiments, ideas, and things I’m actively exploring. It’s less about being "finished" and more about showing how I think, build, and iterate.

The site was created primarily using **v0** by Vercel, with minimal manual design intervention. Most decisions came from prompting, refining, and shaping outputs until they felt right.

## About the Project

This portfolio is intentionally lightweight and flexible. It’s designed to:

* Showcase selected projects and experiments
* Share in-progress ideas and explorations
* Act as a sandbox for testing layouts, interactions, and patterns

Iteration is a core part of the project. The site will continue to evolve over time.

## Built With

* **v0** – Primary tool used to generate and iterate on the UI and structure
* **Next.js** – Application framework
* **React** – Component-based UI
* **Tailwind CSS** – Styling and layout
* **Vercel** – Deployment and hosting

Special credit to **v0 by Vercel** for enabling fast exploration and lowering the barrier between ideas and working interfaces.

---

## How v0 Was Used

* Generating page layouts and components
* Rapidly iterating on structure and visual hierarchy
* Exploring multiple directions quickly
* Refining prompts instead of writing everything from scratch

Design input was added only when the generated output didn’t match what I had in mind.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a standard Next.js structure, keeping things simple and easy to extend:

* `/app` – Pages and routing
* `/components` – Reusable UI components
* `/styles` – Global styles and Tailwind configuration
* `/public` – Static assets
